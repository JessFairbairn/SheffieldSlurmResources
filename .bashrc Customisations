# .bashrc

#  every linux system will have a .bashrc, which does setup tasks each time you log in

#  NOTE you should copy and paste the bits you want into the existing .bashrc
#  file instead of replacing it as it's probably slightly different depending on
#  the distro


# This block is to start  tmux if available. Personal preference.
if command -v tmux &> /dev/null && [ -z "$TMUX" ]; then
    tmux attach -t default || tmux new -s default

# User specific aliases and functions. I put these in a separate file for clarity.
if [ -f ~/.aliases.sh ]; then
