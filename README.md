# Sheffield Slurm Resources
## A series of example scripts and customisations for your Slurm environment on Slurm based HPC clusters. Written for Sheffield students but parts will be useful for all Slurm users

## Files
### .aliases.sh
Some useful commands I have saved as aliases.

### .bashrc Customisations
Some snippets you might want to put in you `.bashrc` file, which runs every time you log in.

### python_gpu_example.slurm
A typical file for creating a batch task in Slurm. This one sets up the environment for a Python script to run, and requests a partition with a GPU.
